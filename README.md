# E-Governance Hackathon

E-Governance refers to the use of digital technologies to enhance government services, improve transparency, and ensure efficient citizen engagement. It enables seamless access to public services, digital record management, and policy implementation through online platforms. However, challenges such as cybersecurity risks, digital identity fraud, inefficient data management, and lack of accessibility hinder its effectiveness.

This hackathon invites participants to develop innovative solutions for:
- Secure digital governance
- Blockchain-based transparency
- AI-driven automation
- Citizen-friendly platforms

The goal is to create scalable, secure, and inclusive e-governance systems that enhance public trust and efficiency in digital government services. Letâ€™s build a smarter future!
